			- Share Contact is a Windows Phone 7/8 application that provides an easy way to share your contact information with other mobile devices. It generates a QR code from your info and shares your contact information with other mobile devices by using global vcard standard.

			User interaction is simple. The user inserts their own information at the first startup and after that the user is able to share their info simply by asking the other person to scan their contact QR code.

			Tech: C#, C++, Windows Phone 7/8

			- Our water usage monitorin solution analysed water consumption by water pipes vibrations and reported the results to AWS cloud service. The product was implemented from a scratch to Nordic Independent Living Challenge. The main rationale behind the idea was to improve elders safety by following their daily water consumption.

			Tech: hardware designing, Arduino C, C#, .NET, AWS

			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://tkln.fi/projects/_control_system_for_puma_560/">Project: Sparkling Wine Robot</a></strong>
			- We got an idea of building a Sparkling Wine Robot for the first of May. So, first we got our sponsor HiQ with us and they helped us to get this project forward. I was responsible of project overall management so I would describe myself as a project coordinator.

			The project included really intense two weeks. We got the mechanical robot with motors and sensors from Tampere but it was missing a powersupply and drivers. So, we designed to implement those on our own.

			Project schedule was tight because we had to wait a few weeks our first hardware batch from China. Middle of the project we noticed schema errors in our circuit boards so we had to fix quite many circuitboards manually.

			We also got a side project by simulating the robot movements on PC. For this, we downloaded the robot's 3D model and coded a simple OpenGL simulation of the robot. We were able to set the robot into different positions and simulate the robot movements.

			Tech: Arduino C, Unix, OpenGL, C++, Math: Inverse Kinematics, Control Theory, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Design, 3D printing

			- Rocket Into The Darkness was our group's demo in Graffathon 2014 competition. We got a special mention from our retro style. We had 24 hours time to create a demo from a scratch, so we decided to go retro-style with spinning tunnel effect with a few extra feature.

			<i class="fa fa-globe"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/Jonux/EdgeDetection/tree/master">Project: Canny-Sobel Edge Detection</a></strong>
			- Canny-Sobel Edge Detection is commonly used in image processing. The algorithm is detecting edges by calculating vertical and horisontal color gradients from a picture. After the gradients, the algorithm uses a soft and hard neighbour mapping to narrow down the edges. 

			I implemented the algorithm by using C++11 and optimized it to work well with large pictures.

			<i class="fa fa-cog"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/Jonux/WineClassification">Project: Wine Classification Challenge</a></strong>
			- I participated to a machine learning challenge where the task was to rate quality of thousands of wines based on their chemical properties. We got 1000 expert analysis from different wines and their chemical properties as a training set.

			We ended up using a multivariable support vector machine (SVM) method, neural networks, and K-nearest neighboards algorithms to solve this problem. We applied different kernel functions and eventually ended up mainly using SVM as our final solution.

			Tech: Matlab

			<i class="fa fa-cog"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.coolbasic.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=40097#p40097">Project: Tetris by Pixels</a></strong>
			- I participated to a fast game compo where limitations were that no media was allowed. So, I decided to implement a tetris game where all graphics are generated from different fractals.

			<i class="fa fa-cog"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/EmbeddedSystems/Car+project+instructions+2015">Project: Line Following Car, AVR</a></strong>
			- Line Following Car was a school project where we implemented a small low level AVR program to keep the car on a white line. The car had eight infra-red sensors and the path was marked on a white tape.

			We implemented a Kalman filter and a PID-controller to keep the vehicle on the track and also monitored the vehicle's battery voltage to adjust the thrust to the car's energy.

			<i class="fa fa-cog"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">Project: Micromachines</a></strong>
			- We implemented a fully functional 2D racing game which included a map editor and multiple special objects. The project was completed in 3 months and it ended up to have over 300 commits and over 15000 lines of source code. We used the latest SFML 2.1 graphic library and Box2D library for collection detection.

			Tech: C++, SFML 2, Box2D, Subversion
			Team: Posio Petri, Huttunen Joel, and Rekola Mikko

			<i class="fa fa-cog"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">Project: Online Game Store</a></strong>
			- We implemented a completely functional online game store which included bank transactions, third-party login systems, user management, and even a few test games to play.

			The user was able to buy and play different games on the website.

			Tech: Python, Django, AWS, Javascript

			- Retro Metro Display was a co-operation project with Aalto University Student Union (AYY). We reverse engineered the 80's display and implemented a python interface to interact with the display. The display was showing a counter when business school students are arriving to Otaniemi.

			Tech: Python, Unix, Bash

			<i class="fa fa-cog"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.coolbasic.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=1078">Project: Artillery</a></strong>
			- Artillery is a legendary 2D shootting game where the players are shootting each other with varying weapons. This is the first graphical game that I have published. The game's AI opponent is estimating the hit positions based on its previous hits. The game also includes varying terain and a few extra features like UFOs and parachutes.
